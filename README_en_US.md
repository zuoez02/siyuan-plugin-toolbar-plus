# Toolbar Enhancement ToolbarPlus
## Features
Option to fix the toolbar at the top
1. Added paragraph indentation control function. How to use: Select the block(s) you plan to adjust the indentation (one or multiple consecutive), click the indentation button to adjust the indentation.
2. Added column control function. How to use: Select the block(s) you plan to adjust the indentation (one or multiple consecutive), click the column button to adjust the indentation.

Note: A known possible issue is that when selecting a block, different selection methods may cause the actual effective block to not necessarily be what you think. If it is applied to the outer block, it is recommended to cancel and select the sub-block again for operation
